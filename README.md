# StarLink: React JS based Starlink Trajectory Visualization

* The visualization dashboard is designed by using ReactJS and D3. 
* The dashboard could track satellites in real-time based on geo-location.
* I built location, altitude, and duration based selector to refine satellite search.

#### I have deployed the service to AWS EC2 for demonstration. The demo is accessible through this link <a href="http://100.25.36.167" target="_blank">StarLink Visualization</a>.
